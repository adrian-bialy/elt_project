# ELT Pipeline with Airflow, MinIO, DuckDB and Streamlit

This project demonstrates an end-to-end ELT pipeline using the following tools:

- **Apache Airflow** – for orchestration
- **MinIO** – as an object storage (S3-compatible)
- **DuckDB** – as a fast local analytical database
- **Streamlit** – for interactive dashboards and data exploration
- **Python** – for writing scripts that extract, load and transform data

## 🔁 Project Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[CoinCap API] --> B[Airflow DAG: extract & save to MinIO]
    B --> C[Airflow DAG: load to DuckDB]
    C --> D[Streamlit Dashboard: visualize data]
```

## Setup

To run the application, please follow these steps:

1. Create a folder named `secrets` in the root directory of the project.
2. Inside the `secrets` folder, create a file named `Api_Key` containing the generated API key from CoinApi.
3. Generate an appropriate API key for the application integration and place it inside the `Api_Key` file.

The `secrets/Api_Key` file is not included in the repository to ensure the security of API keys.


## CoinDataExtractor Class Methods

The `CoinDataExtractor` class provides several methods for fetching, uploading, and loading cryptocurrency data. Below are the key methods available in the class:

### 1. `get_coin_data()`
- **Purpose**: Fetches cryptocurrency data from the CoinCap API for a specified asset (e.g., Bitcoin) starting from a given `start_date` and saves it to a CSV file.
- **Parameters**:
  - `asset_id` (str): The cryptocurrency asset identifier (e.g., `bitcoin`).
  - `start_date` (str, optional): The starting date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. Default is "2021-01-01".
  - `interval` (str, optional): The data interval (e.g., "h1" for hourly). Default is "h1".
- **Usage**:
  - This method is used to fetch historical price data from CoinCap and store it as a CSV file for later processing.

### 2. `upload_file_to_minio()`
- **Purpose**: Uploads the CSV file generated by `get_coin_data()` to MinIO, a local object storage service compatible with S3.
- **Usage**:
  - After fetching the data and saving it to a CSV file, this method uploads the file to MinIO and deletes the local copy.

### 3. `create_bucket()`
- **Purpose**: Creates a bucket in MinIO for the specified asset if it does not already exist.
- **Usage**:
  - This method ensures that there is a dedicated bucket in MinIO for each asset (e.g., Bitcoin), which is required for storing and managing data files.

### 4. `get_last_load()`
- **Purpose**: Returns the date of the last data load from DuckDB, or the start date if no data exists. This helps determine the date from which new data should be loaded.
- **Usage**:
  - This method is useful for incremental data loads, ensuring that only new data is fetched from the CoinCap API.

### 5. `load_data_from_minio_to_duckdb()`
- **Purpose**: Loads data from a CSV file stored in MinIO into DuckDB, creating a table if it does not exist. The method also inserts the new data into the table.
- **Parameters**:
  - `db_name` (str, optional): The name of the DuckDB database. Default is "historical_bitcoin.db".
- **Usage**:
  - This method is used to transfer the data stored in MinIO into a local DuckDB database for analysis and querying. It creates the necessary table structure and performs the data insertion.

By using these methods, you can efficiently fetch, store, and load cryptocurrency data for analysis and visualization.
